                  LTE has a diverse offering across a myriad of sectors and,
                  naturally, has formed partnerships with international
                  conglomerates such as EUROPEAN ENERGY, KUNWON ENGINEERING,
                  COWI, RAMBOLL ENGINEERING and CONNOVATE to further reinforce
                  our commitment to growth. While LTE is committed to the growth
                  South Africa’s proficiency and local talent, importing skills
                  where necessary results in a richly diverse company.
